# EEG Pipeline Python
By Adam Murray

### Description
This is a preprocessing pipeline written in Python primarily using the MNE-Python package.

I plan to work on custom BSS alogirthm in the future. Currently researching existing models and comparing their structures.

### Current Status
- Rewriting script with high modularity.
- Working on inverse operator.

- **On hold until I figure out an EEGLAB IC Label-like solution for ICA.** 
(03/08/2022 looks like an IC_Label port is on the way!! https://github.com/jacobf18/iclabel-python)

# EEG Pipeline Python
By Adam Murray

### Description
This is a preprocessing pipeline written in Python primarily using the MNE-Python package.

### Current Status
- I am currently stuck trying to run dipole fitting to visualize the ICs. 
- Needs to be cleaned up and refactored.

- **On hold until I figure out an EEGLAB IC Label-like solution for ICA.**
